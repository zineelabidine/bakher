# solving the Pitzer equation using "Fminsearch" (matlab)

thermodynamic modeling of phosphoric acid using "Pitzer equation" : 

# Description:
A calculation method is presented in this study to evaluate the ion interaction parameters for the Pitzer model of freezing point and the isopiestic molalities of aqueous phosphoric acid solution.
the code is in matlabe for evaluation of the parameters of Pitzer using the function "Fminsearch".
the equation and mathematical background is presented in our manuscript:

"" Thermodynamic properties and Pitzerâ€™s parameters determination for orthophosphoric acid from the Freezing Point and isopiestic measurement data, Z. Bakher and M. Kaddami, Brazilian Journal of Chemical Engineering, 2018""
